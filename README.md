## Business Context

This model predicts if a borrower will pay back a loan or not. Lending institutions use this to make informed decisions on whether to approve a loan or not, manage credit risks, and reduce default related losses.

## Data source

- [Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data)


## Methods

- Data cleaning,preprocessing and Feature engineering to create predictive variables
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training and evaluation with Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM
- Optuna Hyperparameter tuning 
- SHAP and LIME Model explainability

## Live Demo

🚀 **[Try the Interactive App](https://credit-risk-model-demo.streamlit.app/)**

The trained LightGBM model is deployed as an interactive web application where you can:
- Generate random credit risk predictions
- Upload CSV files for batch predictions
- View model performance metrics

## Tech Stack

- Python (refer to requirement.txt for the packages used in this project)
- Duckdb (aggregating and joining multiple csvs)
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM (machine learning )
- SHAP & LIME (model explainability)
- Optuna (Hyperparameter tuning) 
- Streamlit (interactive web application & deployment)

Top 3 models 

| Model     	         |    AUC-ROC score     |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| LightGBM(tuned)      | 72.57% 	            |
| XGboost  (tuned)     | 72.42% 	            |
| Logistic Regression  | 69.80% 	            |


- ***The final model used is: LightGBM***
- ***Metrics used: Recall, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, Precision,	F1-score, KS, Gini***


## Model Evaluation Strategy

**Primary Metric: ROC-AUC**
Credit risk data is very imbalanced, so ROC-AUC is best here as it measures how well the model does in separating defaulters from non defaulters

**Supporting Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1**
- **Recall** is critical as missing a high-risk borrower leads to real financial loss.
- **Precision** helps ensure we don’t wrongly reject too many good borrowers
- **F1** balances both precision and recall.


## Lessons Learned and Recommendation 

**What I found:**
- Based on the analysis in this project it was found that loan amount, existing debt ratio, and age were the strongest predictors of default
- Hyperparameter tuning barely helped improve the model performance, for example XGBoost went from 0.722349 to 0.724171 AUC and it took over 30 minutes to train. This suggests that features matter more than tuning
- For imbalanced data, AUC-ROC matters way more than accuracy, and the 0.5 threshold doesn't work (except for logistic regression), the optimal threshold was 0.121

**Recommendations:**
- Recommendation would be to focus more on the loan amount when deciding since they carry the most risk and also accept that precision will be low, you'll reject some good customers to catch defaults

## Limitation and What Can Be Improved
- Low precision means 80% of rejected applicants are false positives (lost customers)
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna takes 1+ hours
- Get more data 
- Monitor model performance over time and retrain quarterly
